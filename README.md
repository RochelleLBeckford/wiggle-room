-   [ ] CSS - The Box Model:
    -   [ ] "The Box Model" descibres how an element handles its content and the space around it
    -   [ ] Every element is made of four box layers in the following order, from the innermost to the outermost:
        -   [ ] A "content box" for things like text and images
        -   [ ] A "padding box" of space aroung the content
        -   [ ] A "border box" that goes around the padding
        -   [ ] A "margin box" of empty space that surrounds the whole element

-   [ ] CSS - The Border Box:
    -   [ ] Most elements have a border and to make these borders visible is to add a border to elements using the CSS "border" property
    -   [ ] The "border" property is actually a shorthand that combines the values of multiple properties into one ddeclaration
        -   [ ] "border-width" determines the "thickness" of the border, and is usually set with absolute unites (i.e. pixels)
        -   [ ] "border-style" includes values like "solid", "dashed", "dotted"
        -   [ ] "border-color" can be set with a named color, an rgb() value, or a hexadecimal
    -   [ ] A common-practice for borders is rounding the corners using the "border-radius" property
        -   [ ] Both absolute and relative units can be used. The larger the value, the rounder the corner will be

-   [ ] CSS - The Padding Box:
    -   [ ] Padding is empty space just outside of an element's content:
        -   [ ] <img src="img/b-the-padding-box.png" alt="The Padding Box" width="250">
    -   [ ] The Box Model is set with the "padding" property:
        -   [ ] <img src="img/c-padding-syntax.png" alt="Syntax for padding">
    -   [ ] To give seperate padding values to any side of an element:
        -   [ ] <img src="img/d-seperate-padding-syntax.png" alt="Syntax for seperate padding for any side of an element">
    -   [ ] It is possible to do the same thing four seperate styles using just the "padding" property:
        -   [ ] <img src="img/e-padding-syntax-with-four-different-styles.png" alt="Syntax for padding with four different style">
            -   [ ] From left to right: the values represent the styles for the top, right, bottom, and left sides

            -   [ ] &lt;a href="/privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
                -   [ ] Use the target attribute to open the link path in a new tab instead of the current page
